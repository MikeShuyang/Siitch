The process for building the App:

Download the code from Github
Navigate to Editor ( For me is VS Code)
Go to App directory 
run $npm install
run $npx react-native link
Go to ios directory 
run $pod install
Go back to Editor
run $npm start
Go to the ios file and open the "AwesomeProject.xcworkspace"
After finish building, close the simulator, and go back to Editor and run $r
Go to xcode and run the app
Done!

Make sure to add the dependencies to the package.json if you import the extra libraries
